# Public-Version-Environmental-Monitor



In this project, I utilized the [Metriful MS430 sensor board](https://www.metriful.com/ms430) and a Raspberry Pi 4b to monitor various indoor environmental variables.  
The data is upload to both a time series database in [InfluxDB Cloud](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-cloud/) and to [Tago.IO](https://tago.io/), a cloud based solution for IoT.  Both of these have free tiers.

### **Description of Python Files**  
  

The [log_data_to_InfluxDB.py](log_data_to_InfluxDB.py) is a modification of the IoT cloud logging file supplied by Metriful Ltd.  This file requires the Python package influxdb-client installed.  
This can be installed by
```
pip install influxdb-client
```

The SDS011 particle sensor only has a lifetime about one year under continous operation and is costly for a personal project.  

Therefore, it is desrable to only have it run periodically.  The method given by Mertiful requires additional electronics I don't have easy access to obtain.  

The SDS011 does ship with a serial USB interface and this can utilized to not only obtain data but also set a working period.  

This means I needed to write a new Python script to obtain data from the SDS011 and send the data to InfluxDB Cloud and Tago.IO.  

The file for doing this is [Particle_Logging.py](Particle_Logging.py) and requires the [SDS011 python package](https://pypi.org/project/sds011/) installed.  

```
pip install sds011
```

### **Setting up Services**  
  

To ensure these Python files execute on restart and and if errors occur, I set them up to run as systemd services.  

Change to directory to create an unit file.

```
cd /lib/systemd/system/
```

Create the service.  

```
sudo nano your_service_name.service
```

Place the following text into file.  
```
[Unit]
Description=your custom description
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /path_to_file/file.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=60

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```  
Change the access permissions to python file to allow for it to be run with the following command.

```
sudo chmod +x /path_to_file/file.py
```
Creating a systemd service will ensure the Python files run after the system starts and restart after any errors.  Make sure the path to log_to_influxdb_cloud.py is correct.  

Use the following code to enable, start, and check the status of the service.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable your_service_name.service
sudo systemctl start your_service_name.service
sudo systemctl status your_service_name.service
```
